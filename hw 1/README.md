### Question 1: Tangent line of a function

- Find the equation of the tangent line to the graph of f(x) = 5 + ln(4x^3 - 3) at the abscissa (x-coordinate) point x0 = 1.
  - The importance of the tangent line is that it represents the derivative at a particular point of the function.
  - Derivative: The derivative at a given point is defined as the limit of the average rate of change at that particular point. It's the slope of the tangent line of that point.
  - To find the derivative equation, we'll need to apply some of the **Rules of Differentiation** to the original function and point of interest.

### Question 1: Rules of Differentiation

1. **Rules of Differentiation**:
   Differentiation rules are used to find the derivatives of functions. Some of the fundamental rules include:
   - **Power Rule**: If you have a term in the form (x^n), the derivative is (nx^{n-1}).
   - **Sum/Difference Rule**: If you have a sum or difference of functions, you can find the derivative of each term separately.
   - **Product Rule**: If you have the product of two functions, the derivative is the first function times the derivative of the second plus the second function times the derivative of the first.
   - **Quotient Rule**: If you have the quotient of two functions, the derivative is (derivative of the numerator times denominator) minus (numerator times derivative of the denominator) divided by (denominator squared).
   - **Chain Rule**: For composite functions, you can find the derivative by taking the derivative of the outer function times the derivative of the inner function.
   - **Exponential and Logarithmic Rules**: Derivatives of exponential functions like (e^x) and logarithmic functions like (ln(x)) follow specific rules.
   
   To find the derivative of the original equation, you apply these rules based on the function's composition. For example, if you have (f(x) = 5 + ln(4x^3 - 3)), you can use the power rule for (ln(4x^3 - 3)), the constant rule for 5, and then apply the sum rule.

2. **Finding Points on the Tangent Line**:
   To find points on the tangent line, you need to understand that a line is defined by its slope and a single point on the line. Once you have the derivative (the slope) and a specific point ((x_0, y_0)) on the original function, you can find the equation of the tangent line.

   - The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative (f'(x_0)) at the point (x_0). This slope represents the rate of change of the function at that point.
   - To find another point on the tangent line, you can use the point-slope form of a line: (y - y_0 = m(x - x_0)), where (m) is the slope and ((x_0, y_0)) is the given point.
   - Substitute the known values: (y - y_0 = f'(x_0)(x - x_0)). Now, you have the equation of the tangent line.
   - You can use this equation to find points on the tangent line by choosing different (x) values. Plug in different (x) values into the equation to find the corresponding (y) values on the tangent line.

This process allows you to construct the tangent line by determining how it behaves based on its slope and a single point. By choosing different (x) values and applying the equation, you can find points on the tangent line to compare with the original function at (x_0).
